Debugging is an important process while trying to code something.  Knowing how to do it well lets us figure out how to fix errors that pop up, and probably even more importantly, how to fix errors that *don't* pop up.

### JS Debugging

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

* Syntax errors are erros that are caused by mispelled code or by incorrect naming conventions.

* Logic errors occur when your code runs but it doesn't do what you expect/want it to do.  There are typically no error messages.

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

* I think I mostly run into logic errors when I'm coding.  There were any number of times when I wasn't getting the expected returns that I wanted.  My go to so far has been to console log parts of the loops or other code to try to identify where things are breaking down.

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

* I'm not sure that they really will?  As far as I'm aware that's just part of the process of learning.  The more experience that we have the less we'll probably run into these, but no one is going to catch mistakes 100% of the time.

### The JavaScript Debugger and Console

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

* The debugger tool allows you to view the code of all of the files associated to the webpage that you're currently looking at.  It also lets you run the code and try to more easily determine areas where it is running into problems.

2. Define what a breakpoint is.

* Breakpoints are a point that you determine in the code where JavaScript will stop running.  This allows you to examine variables and other values up to that point in the code in order to suss out things like logic errors.

3. What is the call stack?

* The call stack shows what code has been run up to the point of a breakpoint or whatever line of code you're currently paused on.

### Things I want to know more about

I'd like to look more closely at the debugger and use it on some of my code so that I can see exactly how to use it.
