### Introduction

***

Hey, my name is Hayden Cleaver. <br>  
I'm a former Air Force NCO that worked as a Cryptologic Language Analyst for 6 years.  Now I'm hoping to switch tracks into the tech industry, specifically working with web development. I currently live in Cary, NC which is just outside of Raleigh, but I'd like to move to the Seattle area sometime after finishing the rest of these courses.
