### Growth Mindset

***

Growth mindset is adapting your outlook towards the idea that your knowledge and intellect aren't fixed values and that you can always improve yourself with effort. <br>

Some reminders about growth mindset:

>1. Learn from mistakes and criticism, don't dwell on them.
>2. Don't focus on comparing your progress to the progress of others.
>3. If you're having trouble coming up with a solution, take a break and come back to it.  Don't give up.

### Introduction

***

Hey, my name is Hayden Cleaver. <br>  
I'm a former Air Force NCO that worked as a Cryptologic Language Analyst for 6 years.  Now I'm hoping to switch tracks into the tech industry, specifically working with web development. I currently live in Cary, NC which is just outside of Raleigh, but I'd like to move to the Seattle area sometime after finishing the rest of these courses.
