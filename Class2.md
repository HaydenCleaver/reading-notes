### Text Editors

It's a good idea to research the features of a text editor that you're about to use. <br>
Commonly desired traits are:

1. Code Completion
2. Syntax Highlighting
3. Extensions
4. Themes

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) acts as a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger.

### Terminal

You can use the terminal to enter command lines and follow prompts to navigate the file system of your computer or accomplish other tasks.
This may include creating new directories and/or files.

Each operating system is a little different, and you need to look up their specific command lines in order to correctly use the terminal.
