### Version Control

A Version Control System (VCS) allows you to track changes made to a file and revert them to an earlier format/file if necessary.

***

**Local Version Control**

A singular database on a hardisk that stores changes to files for the user alone.

**Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)**

A single server that stores all files versions and changes.  Can be accessed by multiple users, allowing collaborative work and knowledge of others' changes.

**Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)**

Similar idea to CVCS, but it uses mirrored repositories that can be in multiple locations.  This prevents the loss/corruption of data due to being located in one place alone since data can be easily backed up.  Also allows for simultaneous workflow.
