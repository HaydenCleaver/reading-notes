## Event-Driven Programming

1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

    * EventEmitter which is accessed through `events`.

2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

    * It allows you to better keep objects separated from each other by letting them access information from event-listeners.

3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

    * As far as the backend is concerned, it would help with keeping things organized and self-contained so it could potentially make our code more modular and easy to work with.  It also allows us to more easily perform some sort of action based upon how the user is interacting with our website.

## Things I want to know more about

I think I generally just want to see more examples of event-driven programming in action.  I understand what the reading was describing regarding keeping objects separate and it makes sense, but their example didn't seem all that much more clean or self-contained to me.
