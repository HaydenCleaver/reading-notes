Pictures and other graphics can be important tools to grab attention or make a website look like more than just a blank wall of text.  So learning to put them in our websites is an important step to take.  The same can be said of adjusting text fonts and web page color in CSS.  All of these things make the webpage look more attractive to a user.

## HTML Media

1. `alt` could be useful if a user's sight is impaired somehow or even just if the web browser fails to load the image.
2. Adding alt text or including figure captions can improve the accessibility.
3. If you want a caption to describe a picture, the `figure` element should be used there.
4. To keep it simple, I would probably say that gifs are typically used for very short animated clips, whereas svg is used to create relatively basic icons or pictures.
5. I would probably use PNG because it's supported across most browsers and it has good color depth support.

## CSS

1. I would say that foreground color is what controls the color of the text, while background color dictates the color of the screen.
2. That would probably depend on the goal of the website, but I would probably start by adding in some different border colors and some column colors if applicable.  I might go for a dark theme and change the background to a black/grey color and change the text to white.
3. You need to consider both the font style and the text layout style.
4. `font-size` controls the actual size of the letters; `font-weight` controls how bolded they are; and `font-style` controls how italicized they are.
4. Letter spacing and word spacing could be used to increase the amount of space between words or individual characters. 

## Things I want to know more about

Nothing specific at the moment.  There's so much new information here that I need some time to play around with it.
