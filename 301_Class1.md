# Class 1

These are important new topics into streamlining our use of code and utilizing professional tools that can take us to the next level.

## Component-Based Architecture

1. A component is a self-contained and modular object that is well-defined and can be reused in multiple instances to complete a common task

2. Characteristics:
    > * Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

    >
    
    > * Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.
    >
    > * Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.
    >
    > * Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.
    >
    > * Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.
    >
    > * Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

3. Advantages:
    * They're easy to use and update without breaking other parts of the code.
    * Lower costs associated to third-party tools
    * They're often reusable in other areas which saves even more on costs and efficiency.
    * Their flexibility and self-contained natures make them reliable and they reduce complexity of overall code.

## Props and React

1. 'props' is short for properties.
2. It is a special keyword that passes data from one component to another.
3. Props flow from one direction (from parent to child), known as uni-directional flow.
