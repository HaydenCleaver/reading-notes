# Class 4 Reading Notes

### Wireframing

Wireframing is a practice that allows us to create a rough schematic for the way that we want a website to look.  It can be done by hand or digitally, with each having their own advantages.  Hand drawn drafts are easier to read and update, while digital drafts generally allow for more detail.

You should choose which one you want based off of the requirements of your project.

Generally speaking, try to keep it simple and clear.  It shouldn't be overly complex.

**6 Steps to Wireframing:**

> 1. Do your research:
>       - Understand who your audience is.
>       - Do industry and competitor research on simila ideas.
> 2. Prepare research for quick reference:
>       - keep a cheatsheet or a shortlist of the best features and audience<br>
>        data that you found.
> 3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out:
>       - Have a clear idea of how many pages you'll need.
>       - Try to envision how users will be interacting with your pages <br>
>        and where they'll end up as they traverse each page.
> 4. Draft, don't draw. Sketch, don't illustrate:
>       - Keep things simple for the initial draft.
>       - Don't worry about the particular details of its apperance yet.
>       - Focus on the layout, the functionality, and how the user <br>
>        will interact with it.
> 5. Add detail and get testing:
>       - Good step to demo this to your peers
>       - *Ask more questions about this step?*
> 6. Turn your wireframe into a prototype:
>       - Document and implement feedback from the last step
>       - At this point you can start implementing many more small details <br>
>        and worry about the apperance.
