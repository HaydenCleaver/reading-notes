# Class 6 Notes

### JavaScript

***

JavaScript is a high-level programming language.

It can be used to create functions which pull in input and produce output.  

You can also designate variables which are used to store information.

Variables can be declared using `var`, `const`, and `let`. 

`let` should be used for variables that are possibly going to change, while `const` should be used for variables that will not be changed.

`var` can be used for anything, and is the oldest way to declare them.

### Computers: How do they work?

***

All computers go through a 4 stage mode of operation.

1. Input
2. Storage
3. Processing
4. Output

Binary is the basic foundation which is used to represent all forms of data on a computer.  Numbers, text, images, and videos.

Software interfaces with the Operating System in order to communicate with the computer.
