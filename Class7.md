# Class 7 Reading Notes

## Functions

Functions allow us to reuse code to effeciently apply it to many different problems or situations.

***

Functions are defined by:
```
function functionName(parameter1, parameter2) {
    //code
}
```
Parameters are the elements listed inside the parentheses, and arguments are the values received by the funcition when it's called.

A function is called by:

`functionName();`

A return statement within a function will stop the function and may return a value.

Functions can also be used as a value for a variable.

```
let x = toCelsius(77);
```
***

## Local Variables

Variables that are declared within a function are local to the function.

This means that they can only be utilized from within the function.  They will not be recognized as valid global variables.
