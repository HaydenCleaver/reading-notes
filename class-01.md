# Class 1

The topics discussed in this reading are kind of the introduction to HTML layout and how coding works in general.  

It's important to understand these things so that we know where things are and how they're organized and function.

## HTML

HTML uses elements to create website structure, which are typically created with an opening and closing tag:

`<header></header>`

Attributes are found in the opening tag of an element, and they give us more information about their respective element:

`<h1 style="color:black;">`

In this case 'style' is known as the attribute **name**, while the color is known as the **value**.

HTML pages should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration so as to tell the internet browser which version of HTML is being utilized.  Most browsers will still display the page regardless, but it's a good practice to get into:

`<!DOCTYPE html>`

Global attributes can be used on any element.

ID attributes assign an element a unique value that lets you alter an individual instance of an element.

The CLASS attribute may be used on multiple elements to alter them together.
