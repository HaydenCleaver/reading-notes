## SQL and NoSQL

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL     | NoSQL |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|  Table-based databases  |  document-based databases     |
|  predefined schema   |   dynamic schema     |
|    vertically scalable (increased by hardware power)       |     horizontally scalable (increased by database servers)   |
|     uses structured query language     |     uses unstructured query language     |

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
    * Good for complex query-intensive situations.
2. Give a real world example.
    * Data that is used in lots of queries that make extensive use of nested `and` and `or` statements?

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
    * Data that needs to be changed a lot since it's a dynamic schema?
4. Give a real world example.
    * Some kind of app that takes in user data frequently or needs to be updated regularly.

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
    * NoSQL because of the key-value format used to store large amounts of data (similar to JSON)

6. Which type of database is best for scalability?
    * Depends on what you have available to you, I think?  More hardware to build out a single server, or more servers to increase database structure?

## SQL vs NoSQL Video

1. What does SQL stand for?
    * Structured Query Language

2. What is a relational database?
    * A database that works under certain assumptions and peforms in certain way.
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
    * It works with tables.

4. What is a ‘schema’?
    * defined by fields (columns in database table); ID, name, price, description
        * All records (rows) must follow the schema, even if they hold empty/null data.


5. What is a NoSQL database?
    * built to store large amounts of data in an efficient manner
6. How does it work?
    * It uses databases sorted into collections instead of tables.
7. What is inside of a Mongo database?
    * Collections of data sets that can be organized/structured however you want.
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
    * MongoDB because you don't need to adhere to a strict schema requirements.
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
    * the irregular set up of data means that it can be harder to query or link together specific pieces of data.

## Things I want to know more about

- More real world applications of the two languages.
