### Growth Mindset

***

I view growth mindset as the process of adapting your outlook towards the idea that your knowledge and intellect aren't fixed values, and that you can always improve yourself with effort.

Some reminders about growth mindset:

>1. Learn from mistakes and criticism, don't dwell on them.
>2. Don't focus on comparing your progress to the progress of others.
>3. If you're having trouble coming up with a solution, take a break and come back to it.  Don't give up.

### Github Pages

You can use basic Markdown language to create and format Github pages in a repository without using HTML.  

### Markdown and its Syntax

There are a number of applications that use Markdown (such as Github) that have varied syntax elements, but nearly all of them work off the original Markdown document.
You can use simple characters to create such things as headers, lists (numbered, or unordered), and block quotes, or add links and pictures.

- Headers: "#"
- Lists: can be started with "-" or "1."
- Block quotes: ">"
- Links: "\[Title]\(Web Address)"
